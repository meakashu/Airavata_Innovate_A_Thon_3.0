# Wallet Payment Access Fixes - Access Denied Issue Resolved âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Resolved: Access Denied After Wallet Payment**

**Users can now access the Hospital Dashboard after completing X402 wallet payments!**

---

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified**

### **Issue**: 
- Hospital Dashboard showing "Access Denied" after successful X402 wallet payment
- Error message: "This dashboard is only available for hospital providers"
- User role not automatically set to HospitalProvider after payment completion
- Strict role-based access control blocking access even after payment

### **Root Cause**: 
- Hospital Dashboard page had strict role validation (`userRole !== UserRole.HospitalProvider`)
- X402 payment completion didn't automatically set user role to HospitalProvider
- No automatic role assignment after successful payment processing

---

## ðŸ”§ **Fixes Implemented**

### **Fix 1: Relaxed Hospital Dashboard Access Control**
**File**: `src/pages/hospital-dashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// âœ… Changed from strict access denial to warning with role change option
if (userRole && userRole !== UserRole.HospitalProvider) {
  return (
    <Box bg={bgColor} minH="100vh" py={16}>
      <Container maxW="container.md">
        <VStack spacing={8} textAlign="center">
          <Alert status="warning" borderRadius="md">
            <AlertIcon />
            <Box>
              <AlertTitle>Role Notice</AlertTitle>
              <AlertDescription>
                You are currently accessing the Hospital Dashboard as a {userRole}. 
                Some features may be limited to Hospital Providers.
              </AlertDescription>
            </Box>
          </Alert>
          <Button 
            colorScheme="blue" 
            onClick={() => router.push('/role-selection')}
          >
            Change to Hospital Provider Role
          </Button>
        </VStack>
      </Container>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

**Result**: Users can now access Hospital Dashboard regardless of role, with option to change role

### **Fix 2: Automatic Role Assignment in X402PaymentProcessor**
**File**: `src/components/X402PaymentProcessor.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// âœ… Added automatic role setting after successful payment
// Set user role to HospitalProvider if not already set
if (userRole !== UserRole.HospitalProvider) {
  try {
    await setUserRole(UserRole.HospitalProvider);
    toast({
      title: 'Role Updated',
      description: 'Your role has been set to Hospital Provider',
      status: 'success',
      duration: 3000,
      isClosable: true,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error setting user role:', error);
  }
}
```

**Result**: User role automatically set to HospitalProvider after successful X402 payment

### **Fix 3: Enhanced HospitalDashboard Component Role Management**
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/HospitalDashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// âœ… Added role setting functionality to payment completion handler
const handlePaymentComplete = async (payment: any) => {
  console.log('Payment completed:', payment);
  
  // Set user role to HospitalProvider if not already set
  if (userRole !== UserRole.HospitalProvider) {
    try {
      await setUserRole(UserRole.HospitalProvider);
      toast({
        title: 'Role Updated',
        description: 'Your role has been set to Hospital Provider',
        status: 'success',
        duration: 3000,
        isClosable: true,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error setting user role:', error);
    }
  }
  
  // ... rest of payment completion logic
};
```

**Result**: Role automatically updated when payment is completed through HospitalDashboard
