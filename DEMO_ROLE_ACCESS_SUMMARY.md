## 🔐 **MongoDB Status**

### **Current Implementation**
- ❌ **MongoDB is NOT being used** in the current implementation
- ✅ **Mock data system** is used for demo purposes
- ✅ **Local storage** for role switching
- ✅ **Blockchain-ready** for production deployment

### **Why No MongoDB?**
- **Demo Focus**: Hackathon demo uses mock data for simplicity
- **Blockchain Native**: Production will use smart contracts for data storage
- **IPFS Integration**: Health records stored on IPFS (decentralized)
- **Performance**: Faster demo without database setup

### **Production Database Options**
1. **Smart Contracts** - User profiles and permissions
2. **IPFS** - Health record storage
3. **The Graph** - Indexed blockchain data
4. **MongoDB** - Additional metadata (optional)
