TRUSTBRIDGE PROTOCOL - BUSINESS MODEL & TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================

TrustBridge Protocol is the world's first fully decentralized healthcare data exchange platform that operates without any centralized servers. It solves the $100+ billion annual healthcare data inefficiency problem by creating a patient-owned healthcare ecosystem using blockchain technology, IPFS storage, and decentralized governance.

Key Innovation: Zero centralized data access - no single entity (including platform owners) can access patient health data without explicit consent.

2. THE REAL-WORLD PROBLEM
=========================

Healthcare Data Inefficiency Crisis:
- Healthcare providers waste billions annually due to data inefficiencies
- Patients have no control over their health data and receive no compensation
- Medical errors occur due to incomplete patient information during critical care
- Data silos prevent seamless care coordination across healthcare systems
- Current systems are centralized, vulnerable to breaches, and don't compensate patients

3. TRUSTBRIDGE SOLUTION
=======================

Core Value Proposition:
- Fully decentralized, patient-owned healthcare data exchange
- Zero centralized servers - everything runs peer-to-peer or on-chain
- Patients immediately own and control all uploaded health records

6. HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS
============================

User Registration & Onboarding:
1. Users register through decentralized identity (DID) system
2. Integration with Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask
3. Patient profiles anchored on Ceramic Network
4. Universal QR/NFC wristband issued for emergency access
5. Role-based registration (Patient, Provider, Researcher, DAO Member)

Health Record Upload Process:
1. Healthcare providers upload encrypted data to IPFS
2. Metadata recorded on-chain under patient's DID
3. Providers pay minimal x402 transaction fees
4. Patients immediately own and control uploaded records
5. All consent and access events logged immutably on smart contracts

Data Access & Consent Management:
1. Providers request access to patient records
2. Patients receive notifications and can grant/revoke consent
3. Access granted via time-limited decryption tokens
4. All access events permanently recorded on blockchain
5. Emergency access via multi-signature break-glass protocols

Payment & Revenue Distribution:
1. Providers pay for data access via x402 micropayments
2. Smart contracts automatically split revenue (50% patient, 50% protocol)
3. Real-time earnings tracking and wallet disbursement
4. Patients can withdraw earnings or reinvest in DeFi protocols
5. All transactions transparently recorded on-chain
