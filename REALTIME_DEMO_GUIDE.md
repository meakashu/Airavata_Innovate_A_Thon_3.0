## üéØ **JUDGE PRESENTATION SCRIPT**

### **Opening (1 minute)**
```
"Welcome to TrustBridge Protocol's real-time demonstration. Today I'll show you how different stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem interact in real-time using our blockchain platform.

I have three browser tabs open, each representing a different user type: a patient, a hospital provider, and a pharmaceutical company. Watch how they interact seamlessly in real-time."
```

### **Emergency Scenario (3 minutes)**
```
"Let me start with a critical emergency scenario. In Tab 2, a hospital provider needs emergency access to a patient's data for a heart attack case.

Watch how the request flows in real-time to the patient in Tab 1, who can immediately approve or deny the request. Once approved, the hospital gains instant access to critical patient data."
```

### **Research Scenario (3 minutes)**
```
"Now let me demonstrate our research collaboration system. In Tab 3, a pharmaceutical company requests anonymized patient data for diabetes research, offering 50 TBGT tokens as compensation.

Watch how the patient receives this request in Tab 1, reviews the proposal, and can approve it to earn tokens. This creates a sustainable ecosystem where patients are rewarded for contributing to medical research."
```

### **Tokenomics Demonstration (2 minutes)**
```
"Let me show you our tokenomics in action. As you can see, the patient's token balance increases in real-time when they approve data sharing. These tokens can be used for platform governance, staking rewards, or exchanged for services."
```

### **Technical Highlights (1 minute)**
```
"Behind the scenes, all these interactions are secured by blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, immutability, and patient control. Every data access is logged on the blockchain, creating an auditable trail for compliance and security."
```
