npm run dev

# Application will be available at: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 2: Wallet Setup (CRITICAL)**
1. **Install MetaMask** (if not already installed)
2. **Add Base Sepolia Network**:
   - Network Name: `Base Sepolia`
   - RPC URL: `https://sepolia.base.org`
   - Chain ID: `84532`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
   - Block Explorer: `https://sepolia.basescan.org`

3. **Get Test ETH**:
   - Visit: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Receive test ETH for transactions

### **Step 3: Demo Data Preparation**
```bash
# Create sample health records for demo
# Save these files in your project:
# - sample-lab-report.pdf
# - sample-mri-scan.jpg
# - sample-blood-test.pdf
```

## üé¨ **DEMO SCRIPT (8 minutes)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**:
"Welcome to TrustBridge Protocol - a revolutionary decentralized healthcare data exchange platform. Built on Base network, we're solving the critical problem of patient data ownership."

### **Problem Statement (30 seconds)**:
"Today, patients don't own their health data. Hospitals control it, patients have no say, and research is slowed by data silos."

### **Solution Overview (30 seconds)**:
"TrustBridge changes this by putting patients in control. Using blockchain technology, patients can own, control, and monetize their health data."

### **Live Demo (6 minutes)**:
1. **Wallet Connection** (1 min)
2. **User Registration** (1 min)
3. **Health Record Upload** (1 min)
4. **Consent Management** (1 min)
5. **Payment Processing** (1 min)
6. **Emergency Access** (1 min)

### **Closing (30 seconds)**:
"TrustBridge represents the future of healthcare data exchange - where patients are empowered, research is accelerated, and privacy is protected."

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**:

**Wallet Connection Fails**:
```bash
# Solution: Clear browser cache and restart MetaMask
# Backup: Use different browser
```

**Page Loading Issues**:
```bash
# Check if server is running
npm run dev

# Check console for errors
# Refresh page if needed
```

**Network Issues**:
```bash
# Switch RPC endpoint if needed
# Use alternative: https://base-sepolia.publicnode.com
```

**Transaction Failures**:
```bash
# Check if you have test ETH
# Increase gas limit if needed
# Try smaller transaction amounts
```

## üì± **DEMO TIPS**

### **Presentation Tips**:
1. **Practice the flow** 3-4 times before demo
2. **Have backup plans** for technical issues
3. **Keep it simple** - focus on user experience
4. **Show real interactions** - avoid static screenshots
5. **Highlight blockchain** - emphasize decentralization

### **Technical Tips**:
1. **Test everything** before the demo
2. **Have test data ready** - don't use real patient data
3. **Monitor network** - ensure stable connection
4. **Prepare responses** for technical questions
5. **Show transaction hashes** - prove blockchain integration
