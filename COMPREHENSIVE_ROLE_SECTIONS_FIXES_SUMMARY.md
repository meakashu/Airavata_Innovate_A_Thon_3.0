# Comprehensive Role Sections Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to make every role section functional with realistic sample data and proper navigation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Sample Data**
- **Problem**: All pages were using empty data structures, making them appear broken
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive sample data service (`src/services/sample-data.ts`)

### 2. **Navigation Issues**
- **Problem**: Navigation items pointed to non-existent pages
- **Solution**: Updated all navigation components to use correct routes
- **Files Fixed**:
