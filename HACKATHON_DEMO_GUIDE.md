## üöÄ **DEMO SCRIPT TEMPLATE**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**:
"Good afternoon! I'm excited to present TrustBridge Protocol - a revolutionary decentralized healthcare data exchange platform. Built on Base network, we're solving the critical problem of patient data ownership while enabling secure, transparent healthcare data sharing."

### **Problem Statement (30 seconds)**:
"Today, patients don't own their health data. Hospitals and insurance companies control it, while patients have no say in how it's used or shared. This creates privacy concerns, slows medical research, and prevents patients from benefiting from their own data."

### **Solution Overview (30 seconds)**:
"TrustBridge changes this by putting patients in control. Using blockchain technology, we enable patients to own, control, and monetize their health data while maintaining complete privacy and security."

### **Live Demo (6-7 minutes)**:
[Follow the demo flow above]

### **Closing (30 seconds)**:
"TrustBridge Protocol represents the future of healthcare data exchange - where patients are empowered, research is accelerated, and privacy is protected. Thank you for your attention, and I'm happy to answer any questions!"
