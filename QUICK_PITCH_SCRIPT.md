# âš¡ 60-Second Quick Pitch Script
## Team Airavat - TrustBridge Protocol

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **THE HOOK (0-10 seconds)**
*"2.5 million people die every year from medical errors because doctors can't access patient data when they need it. Healthcare data is worth $200 billion, but patients own 0% of it. This is the crisis Team Airavat is solving."*

---

## ðŸš¨ **THE PROBLEM (10-25 seconds)**
*"Right now, your health data is scattered across dozens of incompatible systems. When you need emergency care, doctors can't see your complete medical history. When researchers need data to find cures, they're blocked by privacy concerns. And when you want to share your data to advance medical science, you get nothing in return."*

---

## ðŸ’¡ **THE SOLUTION (25-45 seconds)**
*"TrustBridge Protocol is the world's first decentralized healthcare data ecosystem. Your health data is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. You control who accesses it, when, and for what purpose. When hospitals need your records, they pay through our X402 micropayment system - you approve, they pay, you earn. When researchers need anonymized datasets, they pay the protocol, and you get a share of the revenue. It's your data, your control, your earnings."*

## ðŸš€ **THE OPPORTUNITY (45-60 seconds)**

With 7.8 billion potential users worldwide, this is a $200 billion market opportunity. TrustBridge Protocol flips the current model, putting value back in the hands of data owners - the patients. Team Airavat is ready to revolutionize global healthcare. The crisis is real. The solution is here. The time to act is now."*
